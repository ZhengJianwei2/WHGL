This is the code of our paper "Multi-dimensional Visual Data Completion via Weighted Hybrid Graph-Laplacian", currently submitting to SP. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact usï¼š"jjw@zjut.edu.cn" or "zjw@zjut.edu.cn"
## Highlight 
* A new weighted hybrid graph Laplacian regularization for visual completion.  
* Combinations of local and non-local, first and second-order graph can portray the image spatial structure well.  
* Weighted strategy improves completion performance at high missing rates.  
* Our model is a positive definite Euler-Lagrange equation and can be solved by PCG or GMRES with high efficiency.  
* Our model can be generalized to different completion tasks such as de-clouding, hyperspectral inpainting, etc.
